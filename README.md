![Cryptoversumi](https://i.ibb.co/8gh5Jc8/image.png)

## Introduction
Frontend is made with a react.
Backend with Javascript

React Components seen by the user:
- Navbar 
- Homepage 
- Charts (Data and widgets provided by Tradingview.com)
- Cryptocurrencies (Data from RapidAPi backend)
- Exchanges (Data from RapidAPi backend)
- News (Data from RapidAPi backend)

Backend data is fetched from the RapidApi:
- (Apikeys, querys, endpoints)

The websites idea is to show the biggest cryptos in the world, their market cap and so on.

Also the charting possibility is available, so that you see the real-time chartdata 

There are so many possibilities that I wanted to add to this project, but the time limit is too short to 
add all of those functionalities. Also taking account of my skill level.

The project is still in progress and in the future it will have the members area, which will
have some special stuff about trading and so on.
