## Introduction
Frontend is made with a react and the data to backend is fetched from the site named rapidapi.

The websites idea is to show the biggest cryptos in the world, their market cap and so on.

There are so many possibilities that I wanted to add to this project, but the time limit is too short to 
add all of those functionalities. Also taking account of my skill level.

The project is still in progress and in the future it will have the members area, which will
have some special stuff about trading and so on.
